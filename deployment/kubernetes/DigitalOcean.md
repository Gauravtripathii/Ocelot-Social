# DigitalOcean

If you want to set up a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com), follow this guide.

## Create Account

Create an account with DigitalOcean.

## Add Project

On the left side you will see a menu. Click on `New Project`. Enter a name and click `Create Project`.  
Skip moving resources, probably.

## Create Kubernetes Cluster

On the right top you find the button `Create`. Click on it and choose `Kubernetes - Create Kubernetes Cluster`.

- use the latest Kubernetes version
- choose your datacenter region
- name your node pool: e.g. `pool-<your-network-name>`
- 2 `Basic node` with a total of 4GB and 2 shared CPUs are enough to start with
- no tags necessary
- set your cluster name: e.g. `cluster-<your-network-name>`
- select your project

## Getting Started

After your cluster is set up, see progress bar above, click on `Getting started`. Please install the following management tools:

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [doctl](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl)

Install the tools as described on the tab or see the links here.

After the installation, click on `Continue`.

### Download Configuration File

Follow the steps to download the configuration file.

You can skip this step if necessary, as you can download the file later. You can then do this by clicking on `Kubernetes` in the left menu. In the menu to the right of the cluster name in the cluster list, click on `More` and select `Download Config`.

### Patch & Minor Version Upgrades

Skip `Patch & Minor Version Upgrades` for now.

### Install 1-Click Apps

You don't need a 1-click app. Our helmet script will install the required NGINXs.
Therefore, skip this step as well.

## DNS Configuration

There are the following two ways to set up the DNS.

### Manage DNS With A Different Domain Provider

If you have registered your domain or subdomain with another domain provider, add an `A` record there with one of the IP addresses from one of the cluster droplets in the DNS.

To find the correct IP address to set in the DNS `A` record, click `Droplets` in the left main menu.
A list of all your droplets will be displayed.
Take one of the IPs of perhaps two or more droplets in your cluster from the list and enter it into the `A` record.

### Manage DNS With DigitalOcean

TODO: Describe what the purpose is and how to implement it â€¦

## Deploy

Yeah, you're done here. Back to [Deployment with Helm for Kubernetes](deployment/kubernetes/README.md).
